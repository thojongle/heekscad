The best thing to do is use the discussion group: http://groups.google.com/group/heekscad-users

or if you are helping to develop the software use this group:  http://groups.google.com/group/heekscad-devel

You might also want to join the #cam IRC channel on freenode where most of the HeeksCAD developers hang out.

This  #cam IRC channel is logged at http://camlog.archivist.info/
