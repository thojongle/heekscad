# Introduction #

The following resources may be useful, especially to new users of HeeksCAD and HeeksCNC.  Some of this is not official documentations so features and user interface may have changed significantly.

## Using HeeksCad ##
Probably the best place to get started is the wiki page [UsingHeeksCAD](UsingHeeksCAD.md)

## Digital Machinist Article ##
[No Secrets: Open-source CAM Application Bares All ](http://sliptonic.com/?p=491)  A good general introduction to HeeksCAD and HeeksCNC with examples.


## Creating a pump housing with HeeksCAD ##
An illustrated tutorial by Andr√© Pascual, introducing some of the
basics functions of HeekCAD to build a pump housing.
The links will redirect you to a french forum but anyone should be
able to understand it as this tutorial is a kind of "Babel" tutorial
with just images.
