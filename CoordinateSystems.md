Press the Coordinate System button or from the menu choose Geometry->"Add Coordinate System"

Follow the instructions on the input tab:
**Pick the location** Pick a point on the x-axis
**Pick a point where y>0**

This will make a new coordinate system which will now be active.
Any drawing will happen on the XY, XZ, YZ planes of this coordinate system.
Whichever plane is most facing the camera will be the one that is drawn on.

To use the world coordinate system, either:
**delete the active coordinate system** right-click on the active coordinate system and choose ( "unset coordinate system active" )
